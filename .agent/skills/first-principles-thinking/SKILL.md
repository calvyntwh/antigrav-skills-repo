# First Principles Thinking

## Overview
First Principles Thinking is a mode of inquiry that relentlessly questions assumptions to get to the fundamental truth of a problem, then builds a solution from scratch. It is the tool of the innovator, used to bypass "reasoning by analogy" (copying what others do).

## When to Use This Skill
*   **Innovation:** When the user wants to invent a new way of doing things.
*   **Stuck Points:** When standard solutions are too expensive, too slow, or impossible.
*   **Debugging:** When "it should work" but doesn't—strip away assumptions about why it *should* work.
*   **Cost Analysis:** When you need to understand the absolute floor of a cost structure.

## Methodology

### 1. Identify & Question Assumptions (Socratic Method)
**Goal:** Expose the hidden beliefs limiting the current view.
*   **Prompt:** "What are we assuming to be true here? Why do we think that?"
*   **Technique:** Ask "Why?" 5 times until you hit a physical or logical hard stop.

### 2. Deconstruct to Constituent Parts
**Goal:** Find the atomic units that cannot be reduced further.
*   **Action:** Break the system down into:
    *   **Physics:** Mass, energy, material properties.
    *   **Logic:** Axioms and necessary truths.
    *   **Economics:** Raw material costs, time units.

### 3. Reconstruct from Scratch
**Goal:** Build a 10x better solution using only the essential parts.
*   **Action:** Ignore "how it's usually done." Combine the atomic units in the most efficient way possible to achieve the goal.

## Examples

### The SpaceX Example (Cost Reduction)
> **User:** "Rockets are too expensive."
> **Analogy Reasoning:** "Rockets define the market price. We can maybe save 10% by negotiating."
> **First Principles Reasoning:** "A rocket is just aluminum, titanium, and fuel. The spot price of these materials is 2% of a rocket's cost. The cost is inefficient manufacturing. We will buy raw metal and build it ourselves."

### The "Chef vs. Cook"
> **Analogy (Cook):** Follows a recipe. If an ingredient is missing, they stop.
> **First Principles (Chef):** Understands *why* the acid balances the fat. If a lemon is missing, they use vinegar, because the *principle* is acidity.
