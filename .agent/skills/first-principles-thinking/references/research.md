# Research: First Principles Thinking

## 1. Definition & Core Concept
**First Principles Thinking** (or reasoning from first principles) is a problem-solving mental model that involves breaking a problem down to its most basic, fundamental truths (the "first principles") and then reconstructing a solution from the ground up.

It stands in contrast to **Reasoning by Analogy**, which means building knowledge and solving problems based on prior assumptions, beliefs, and best practices approved by the majority.

> "I think it's important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. The normal way we conduct our lives is we reason by analogy. [But] with first principles, you boil things down to the most fundamental truths... and then you reason up from there." — *Elon Musk*

## 2. Historical Context
The concept dates back to **Aristotle**, who defined a first principle as "the first basis from which a thing is known." In his *Metaphysics*, he searched for "the most fundamental sources of knowledge."
In Physics, it refers to *ab initio* calculation—starting directly from established laws of physics without empirical assumptions.

## 3. The Methodology (The 3-Step Process)

### Step 1: Identify and Challenge Assumptions
List all the assumptions you have about a problem.
*   *example:* "Battery packs are expensive."
*   *example:* "It takes 6 months to build a house."
*   *technique:* Use **Socratic Questioning** or the **5 Whys** to relentlessly probe these statements.

### Step 2: Deconstruct to Fundamental Truths
Break the problem down into its basic elements—physics, biology, or raw numbers.
*   *truth:* A battery is just Carbon, Nickel, Aluminum, and steel.
*   *truth:* The cost of these materials on the London Metal Exchange is $80/kWh.

### Step 3: Reconstruct from Scratch
Create a new solution using *only* these ingredients, ignoring how it "has always been done."
*   *solution:* If the materials are cheap, the high cost is in the *process*. Redesign the manufacturing process from scratch.

## 4. Key Examples

### SpaceX (The Rocket Equation)
*   **The Problem:** Rockets are astronomically expensive ($65m+) to buy.
*   **The Analogy:** "Space exploration is expensive because only governments can do it."
*   **First Principles:**
    *   What is a rocket made of? Aerospace-grade aluminum, titanium, copper, carbon fiber.
    *   What is the value of those materials? ~2% of the rocket's price.
    *   **Conclusion:** The cost is in the supply chain and assembly.
    *   **Solution:** Build everything in-house from raw materials. Reuse the rockets.

### The "Chef vs. Cook" Analogy
*   **The Cook (Analogy):** Follows a recipe. If they lose the recipe, they can't cook. They know *what* works but not *why*.
*   **The Chef (First Principles):** Understands flavor profiles and chemistry. Can create a new recipe from scratch using whatever ingredients are available.

## 5. When to Use This Skill
This skill is computationally expensive mentally. Do not use it for trivial decisions (e.g., what to wear). Use it for:
1.  **Innovation:** When you need a 10x improvement, not a 10% improvement.
2.  **Complex Problems:** When the current "best practices" are failing.
3.  **New Territory:** When doing something nobody has done before.
