# Research: The Pareto Principle

## 1. Core Concept
For many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes. This indicates non-linearity in input/output relationships.

## 2. Origins & Key Figures
*   **Vilfredo Pareto (1896):** Italian economist who published *Cours d'économie politique*, observing that 80% of land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population. He also noted 20% of the peapods in his garden yielded 80% of the peas.
*   **Joseph Juran (Quality Control):** Discovered Pareto's work in 1941 and applied it to quality issues (80% of problems vary from 20% of causes). He coined the terms "Vital Few" and "Trivial Many" (later "Useful Many").

## 3. Related Concepts
### Power Laws (Zipf's Law)
Pareto is a specific instance of a Power Law distribution ($Y = kX^{-\alpha}$). In these distributions, the "head" is massive and the "tail" is very long.
*   *Examples:* Word frequency, city sizes, website traffic, bug severity.

### Price's Law
The square root of the number of people in a domain account for 50% of the total output.
*   *Implication:* As teams grow, the ratio of productive people shrinks drastically.

## 4. Application to Engineering
*   **Optimization:** 20% of the code consumes 80% of the CPU cycles. Optimize that loop; ignore the rest.
*   **Bug Fixing:** 20% of the bugs cause 80% of the user crashes. Fix those first.
*   **Product Management:** 20% of the features drive 80% of the usage. Build an MVP.
