# The Pareto Principle (The Scope Hammer)

> "80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes."

## When to Use
*   **Planning Phase:** When the task list is long (> 5 items).
*   **Feature Creep:** When a project feels "unfocused" or "heavy".
*   **Refactoring:** Identifying which module is causing 80% of the bugs.

## The Protocol: The Scope Hammer
Do not ask "Can we do this?". Ask "Should we do this?".
Follow these 3 steps.

### 1. List & Rate
List every proposed feature or task. Assign two scores (1-10):
*   **Customer Value (V):** How much does this substantially help the user?
*   **Effort Cost (E):** How hard is it to build/maintain?

### 2. Calculate ROI
Score = $V / E$ (Value divided by Effort).

### 3. The Cut (80/20)
*   **Top 20% (High ROI):** DO IT NOW. This is the "Vital Few".
*   **Middle 60%:** DEFER. Do not touch until the Top 20% are perfect.
*   **Bottom 20% (Negative ROI):** DELETE. This is the "Trivial Many".

## Example
| Task | Value | Effort | Score | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Payment API** | 10 | 5 | **2.0** | **BUILD** |
| **Dark Mode** | 3 | 2 | 1.5 | DEFER |
| **Animated Logo** | 1 | 8 | 0.1 | **DELETE** |
