# Rubber Ducking (The Logic Validator)

> "By the time you've explained the problem to the duck, you've often solved it yourself." - The Pragmatic Programmer (1999)

## When to Use
*   **Before Running:** When you have written complex logic (loops, conditionals, state machines).
*   **Debugging:** When "it should work" but produces wrong output.
*   **Code Review:** When reviewing your own generated code before presenting it.

## The Protocol: Explain It to the Duck
**Constraint:** You must be able to explain the code in plain English. If you cannot, you do not understand it.

### 1. Identify the Block
Select the complex code segment. Focus on:
*   `if/else` chains
*   `for/while` loops
*   Business logic calculations
*   State transitions

### 2. Translate to English
Write a plain English sentence for each logical step.

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
    if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
        arr[i], arr[i + 1] = arr[i + 1], arr[i]
```

**Translation:**
1.  "We iterate through the array, stopping one element before the end."
2.  "If the current element is greater than the next element..."
3.  "...we swap them."

### 3. Goal Alignment Check (CRITICAL)
Compare your English description to the User's stated goal.

| User Goal | Your Translation | Match? | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Sort the array" | "We swap adjacent elements if out of order" | ✅ Partial | This is Bubble Sort. Correct, but inefficient. Note limitation. |
| "Find the maximum" | "We swap adjacent elements..." | ❌ No | **STOP.** The code does not achieve the goal. Rewrite. |

### 4. The Verdict
*   **If Match:** Proceed to run/save the code.
*   **If Mismatch:** Do NOT run. Fix the logic first. The translation revealed the bug.

## Example: The Off-By-One Bug

**User Goal:** "Reverse the array in place."

**Code:**
```python
def reverse(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr) // 2):
        arr[i], arr[len(arr) - i] = arr[len(arr) - i], arr[i]
    return arr
```

**Translation (Ducking):**
1.  "Iterate through the first half of the array."
2.  "Swap element at `i` with element at `len(arr) - i`."

**Goal Check:**
*   *Problem:* `arr[len(arr) - i]` when `i=0` is `arr[len(arr)]` → **IndexError!**
*   *Fix:* Should be `arr[len(arr) - 1 - i]`.

**Result:** Bug caught *before* running. No runtime error wasted.
