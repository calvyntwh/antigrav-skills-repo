# Research: Systems Thinking

## 1. Core Concept
Systems Thinking is a holistic approach to analysis that focuses on the way that a system's constituent parts interrelate and how systems work over time and within the context of larger systems.

> "A system is a set of things—people, cells, molecules, or whatever—interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time." - Donella Meadows

## 2. Origins & Key Figures
*   **Jay Forrester (MIT):** Founder of System Dynamics (1956). He applied engineering feedback control theory to social and economic systems.
*   **Ludwig von Bertalanffy:** Biologist who founded General Systems Theory (GST) in the 1940s, emphasizing that living organisms are open systems.
*   **Donella Meadows:** Author of *Thinking in Systems*. She created the "12 Leverage Points" framework.
*   **Peter Senge:** Popularized systems thinking in business with *The Fifth Discipline* (1990), focusing on "learning organizations".

## 3. Key Dynamics
*   **Feedback Loops:** Mechanisms that control change.
    *   *Reinforcing (Positive):* Compound interest, virality, population growth.
    *   *Balancing (Negative):* Thermostat, hunger, market correction.
*   **Emergence:** Behaviors that arise from the interaction of parts, not the parts themselves (e.g., Consciousness, Traffic Jams).
*   **Delays:** The time gap between Action and Result. Delays cause oscillation (over-correction).

## 4. Application to Engineering
*   **Distributed Systems:** Microservices are complex adaptive systems.
*   **DevOps:** CI/CD pipelines are feedback loops. Fast feedback = Stability.
*   **Stability Patterns:** Circuit Breakers (Balancing Loop), Auto-scaling (Balancing Loop), Retries (Reinforcing Loop - Dangerous!).
