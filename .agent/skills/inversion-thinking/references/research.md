# Research: Inversion Thinking

## 1. Core Concept
Inversion is the practice of looking at a problem backward. Instead of asking "How do I achieve X?", you ask "How do I usually fail to achieve X?" and then avoid those causes.

> "Invert, always invert." - Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi

## 2. Origins & Key Figures
*   **The Stoics (Premeditatio Malorum):** Ancient Roman philosophy (Seneca, Marcus Aurelius) practiced "negative visualization" — imagining the worst-case scenario to prepare for it. They called this *premeditatio malorum* (premeditation of evils).
*   **Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi (Mathematics):** 19th-century mathematician who found that complex problems could often be solved by re-expressing them in inverse form ("man muss immer umkehren").
*   **Charlie Munger (Business):** Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman popularized Inversion in business. He famously said, "All I want to know is where I'm going to die so I'll never go there."

## 3. Methodologies
### The Pre-Mortem (Gary Klein)
Project management technique coined by Gary Klein (HBR, 2007) where the team assumes the project *has already failed* and works backward to determine why. This is based on "prospective hindsight", which increases the ability to identify reasons for future outcomes by 30%.

### Via Negativa (Nassim Taleb)
Improvement by subtraction or avoidance. "It is easier to know what is wrong than what is right."

## 4. Application to Engineering
*   **Security:** Red Teaming / Penetration Testing is pure Inversion.
*   **Reliability:** Chaos Engineering (Netflix Simian Army) forces failure to verify resilience.
*   **Design:** anti-patterns help define what *not* to do.
